# Water-Sort-Puzzle
Description:
This is the code to a water sort puzzle game I coded in the subject CMPG 221, in my second year of studying Information Technology, using Java.

Problem that my code solves:
My code solves a problem where glasses contains different colours and then sorts the colours so that all the glasses has the same colour in it.

Brief description of my problem solving approach:
I use a Rational problem solving approach, which follows 7 steps. It begins with me defining the problem, then I identifie the causes of the problem,
which follows with me brainstorming different solutions. Thereafter I select the best option and create a plan to implement the solution.
Next I execute the plan I selected and I evaluate if the solution is sufficient.
